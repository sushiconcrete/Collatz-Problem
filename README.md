# Collatz-Problem
- This code generates Collatz sequences for a range of integers and determines which integer within that range has the longest Collatz sequence.
- Core ideas for optimization: Linked List, Recursion, Hashmap
- This code is effective in terms of time complexity due to the use of memoization. The Collatz sequences for numbers are stored in the hash map as they're generated, so the program can quickly retrieve them later instead of recalculating them each time.
